**EFFICIENT-IN-GARBAGE-COLLECTION**

**Working Model**
Project Overview
The Automated Garbage Collection Optimization Tool is designed to enhance memory management by efficiently identifying and reclaiming unused memory in a system. Inefficient garbage collection can lead to memory leaks, performance degradation, and system crashes. This tool automates memory tracking, optimizes resource deallocation, and provides insights into memory usage patterns.

**Goals:**
Detect memory leaks by analyzing object references and heap usage.

Optimize garbage collection by identifying unreachable objects efficiently.

Visualize memory allocation graphs to help users understand memory consumption.

Suggest optimization strategies, such as tuning garbage collection parameters or implementing better memory management techniques.

**Expected Outcomes:**
A tool that can analyze runtime memory usage and detect inefficiencies.

Visual representation of object dependencies and memory allocation.

Recommendations to optimize garbage collection and prevent memory leaks.

**Scope:**
Focuses on improving garbage collection in managed runtime environments like JVM, .NET, or Python's GC.

Applicable for developers, performance engineers, and educational purposes.
